Pep Talk for Frazzled Moms

Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime StoriesTranscript for GitHub

Hey. You showed up today.

You didn’t march through tear gas. You didn’t make a sign or go viral or testify before Congress.You just got your kid dressed. Or fed. Or calmed after a meltdown. Or you let them wear rain boots in 80-degree weather because it wasn’t the hill you needed to die on today.

But here’s the thing no one says loudly enough:You are still resisting.

In a culture that wants everything polished, obedient, profitable, and efficient—raising a child with empathy, autonomy, and critical thought is a radical act.

Reading banned books at bedtime? That’s protest.Feeding someone when capitalism says food is earned, not shared? Protest.Teaching your kid that anger can be sacred and soft things aren’t weak? Protest.Keeping your community tethered through care and small check-ins? Protest.Refusing to fake it when you're broken and showing your child what repair looks like?That’s not failure. That’s resistance training.

Soft authoritarianism thrives on exhaustion, disconnection, and doubt.It wants you to believe that only huge, loud acts count.That if you’re not on the front lines, you’re not doing enough.

But when you raise a child who can name injustice and kindness in the same breath—when you create a home where feelings are processed instead of punished—you’re doing the quiet groundwork that movements are built on.

You are shaping a human who will not mistake cruelty for order.A human who will recognize propaganda in a textbook.A human who might lead, who might protest, who might write fables of their own—because they grew up in a house where resistance lived in the everyday.

So no, maybe you didn’t march today.But you kept the portal open.And that? That matters more than you know.
