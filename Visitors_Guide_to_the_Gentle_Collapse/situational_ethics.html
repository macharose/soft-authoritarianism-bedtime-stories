<h2>📖 Chapter 8: Situational Ethics and Other Nonbinary Tools for Civil Disobedience</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You can’t dismantle the master’s house with the master’s tools.”<br>
  — Audre Lorde</p>
  <p>“But I can take their shed, turn it into a mobile clinic, and siphon their gas while I’m at it.”<br>
  — You, probably</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>📌 Section 1: Consent & Collateral</h3>

<p><strong>When is it ok to lie to a cop?</strong><br>
Always. This is a trick question. Cops are trained to lie to you. You’re trained to make polite eye contact with HR reps. One of these is more dangerous than the other.</p>

<p><strong>The Ethics of Tricksterism</strong><br>
Inspired by figures like Anansi, Coyote, and Robin Hood: deception as survival and community service.</p>

<h3>📌 Section 2: Theft vs. Redistribution</h3>

<p><strong>Stealing from Walmart: Ethical or Spiritual?</strong><br>
If you’re stealing insulin, baby formula, or anything locked in a plexiglass cabinet while the CEO buys a fifth yacht—it’s community care.</p>

<p><strong>Your UBI Was Denied, But You “Borrowed” A Printer</strong><br>
You needed to print signs for a protest. The real crime is ink cartridge pricing.</p>

<h3>📌 Section 3: Violent vs. Nonviolent vs. Symbolic</h3>

<p><strong>Molotovs: When Matches Won’t Cut It</strong><br>
This is where we remind readers to read The Anarchist Cookbook only as historical context and not a PDF you found on Reddit.</p>

<p><strong>Kidnapping a Senator With Vibes (a Thought Experiment)</strong><br>
Don’t do it. But if you did, let’s talk about symbolism, civil mythology, and how to write fiction as a blueprint.</p>

<h3>📌 Section 4: Self-Defense in a Collapsing Empire</h3>

<p><strong>Emotional Boundaries As Resistance</strong><br>
Not every battle needs a weapon. Some just need you to stop texting back.</p>

<p><strong>When the National Guard is on the Subway</strong><br>
Are you protecting yourself? Or are you witnessing history? Either way: wear good shoes.</p>

<h3>📌 Section 5: The Soft Authoritarian’s Dilemma</h3>

<p><strong>Can You Be Benevolent and Ruthless?</strong><br>
Yes. It’s called parenting.</p>

<p><strong>What Is the Ethical Limit of a Government With Soul?</strong><br>
Let’s discuss truth commissions, restorative justice, and why your state-funded media still slaps.</p>
