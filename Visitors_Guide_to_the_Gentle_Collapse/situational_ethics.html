  <p class="lead">Ethics in distress; when do the rules *actually* apply?</p>

  <p>📖 Chapter 8: Situational Ethics and Other Nonbinary Tools for Civil Disobedience
    “You can’t dismantle the master’s house with the master’s tools.”
    — Audre Lorde
    “But I can take their shed, turn it into a mobile clinic, and siphon their gas while I’m at it.”
    — You, probably
    
    📌 Section 1: Consent & Collateral
    When is it ok to lie to a cop?
    Always. This is a trick question. Cops are trained to lie to you. You’re trained to make polite eye contact with HR reps. One of these is more dangerous than the other.
    
    The Ethics of Tricksterism
    Inspired by figures like Anansi, Coyote, and Robin Hood: deception as survival and community service.
    
    📌 Section 2: Theft vs. Redistribution
    Stealing from Walmart: Ethical or Spiritual?
    If you’re stealing insulin, baby formula, or anything locked in a plexiglass cabinet while the CEO buys a fifth yacht—it’s community care.
    
    Your UBI Was Denied, But You “Borrowed” A Printer
    You needed to print signs for a protest. The real crime is ink cartridge pricing.
    
    📌 Section 3: Violent vs. Nonviolent vs. Symbolic
    Molotovs: When Matches Won’t Cut It
    This is where we remind readers to read The Anarchist Cookbook only as historical context and not a PDF you found on Reddit.
    
    Kidnapping a Senator With Vibes (a Thought Experiment)
    Don’t do it. But if you did, let’s talk about symbolism, civil mythology, and how to write fiction as a blueprint.
    
    📌 Section 4: Self-Defense in a Collapsing Empire
    Emotional Boundaries As Resistance
    Not every battle needs a weapon. Some just need you to stop texting back.
    
    When the National Guard is on the Subway
    Are you protecting yourself? Or are you witnessing history? Either way: wear good shoes.
    
    📌 Section 5: The Soft Authoritarian’s Dilemma
    Can You Be Benevolent and Ruthless?
    Yes. It’s called parenting.
    
    What Is the Ethical Limit of a Government With Soul?
    Let’s discuss truth commissions, restorative justice, and why your state-funded media still slaps.
