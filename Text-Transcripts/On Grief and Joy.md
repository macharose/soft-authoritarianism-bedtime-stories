# 006 — On Grief and Joy, in the Heartless State

*Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories*

Once, a little girl lost her dog—a true companion, a friend, a soul mate.  
His name was Cesar. He was family. And then he was gone.

She didn’t know how to say all that yet.  
But she *felt* it.  
In her chest. In her bones. In the way she carried his memory like a favorite blanket she didn’t want to let go of.

She wept.  
Quietly. Loudly. Confused and clear all at once.  
And in her grief, she taught her mother something important:  
**Love leaves a shape behind.** And that shape deserves space.

The world outside didn't know how to sit with sadness.  
It rushed toward perfection. Plastic. Algorithms. Smile-for-the-camera culture.  
It sold "healing" in the form of distractions—new toys, shiny filters, promises of happy endings.

But grief isn't a bug in the system. It's a feature of love.  
And in a state that punishes slowness, stillness, or softness—  
grieving with your whole heart is rebellion.

So we grieved together.

We talked about Cesar.  
We drew pictures of him.  
We said his name out loud.  
We said: **“We are sad because we love him that much.”**

There was no fixing it.  
No filling the space with stuff.  
Only holding it.

That holding—  
is how we remember.  
That holding—  
is how we resist.

### Listener Reflection Prompt:

- What grief are you carrying that the world tells you to hide?
- How can you honor your love instead of numbing your loss?
- What does emotional intelligence look like in your home?

### Ritual Invitation:

Create a small altar for someone or something you've lost.  
It could be a photo, a collar, a flower, or just a rock that feels like them.  
Let it stay for a while. Let it speak.

### Additional Notes:

This story was born from watching my daughter deeply miss our dog, Cesar.  
He was more than a pet—he was a soul companion.  
In her sadness, I saw not weakness but clarity: an emotional honesty that so many of us lose as we grow.  
I want to teach her, and remind myself, that grief is not something to escape.  
It’s proof of love.  
And in this world, where feelings are flattened by consumerism, allowing ourselves to truly mourn is an act of resistance.  
Stay tender. Stay real. Hold the space.
