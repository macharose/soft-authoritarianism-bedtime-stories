A fable within this fable. 

A world where books were outlawed, where joy and art were criminalized, where beauty was rebranded as dangerous.

 The thing is—
    That world didn’t look like a nightmare.
    It looked like a slow, quiet shift.
    Like water heating under a frog.
    He warned us.

Tahar. 

 All of us—that when authoritarianism begins to stretch its grubby little fingers into our     
 
    schools, our culture, our language, our stories,
    when questioning becomes dangerous,
    fiction becomes fatal.

I want to scream. 
But with a whisper.

 I've realized how fast freedom can vanish
 when we stop noticing the temperature rise.

When we fail to notice the absurdity of complacency. 

But that is dangerous. 
    Tahar was murdered.
    They tried to erase him—
    from the world, from memory, from meaning.
    But they forgot:

 You cannot unwrite what’s already been read.

### 📎 Additional Notes

I read *The Last Summer of Reason* around 2010, and it’s one of the few books that stuck with me—living in my subconscious as I watched the world unravel.

When I learned that the author, **Tahar Djaout**—an Algerian journalist and poet—was murdered for being anti-authoritarian, I knew this was something I’d need to keep my eye on where I live.

And here we are.

In our technofascist future,  
watching oligarchs feud on Twitter.

*The Last Summer of Reason* helped me understand how **Soft Authoritarianism** fades into full authoritarianism. Though a work of fiction, it shows how easily things start small and innocuous—until they’re at your door.

I want this fable to awaken you.  
To help you feel the slow boil under our feet.  
To remind you: we still have the words.

Write like someone is reading in secret.
