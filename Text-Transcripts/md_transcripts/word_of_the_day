# 014 — Word of the Day Is Propaganda

It was Election Day in New York City.  
The air was thick with humidity and the scent of last-minute promises.

Canvassers fanned out across sidewalks, train stations, playground entrances—grinning wide and armed with glossy flyers.  
Some wore branded shirts. Some carried clipboards. Most carried the same assumption: that handing a bright-colored political ad to a 3-year-old was “cute.”

And maybe it was.

Until she looked up and asked:  
**“Why they give me this?”**

I didn’t flinch.  
I looked her in the eyes and said,  
**“Today’s word of the day is propaganda.”**

Her grip tightened on the flyer like it had just grown teeth.  
The canvasser laughed nervously.  
I did not.

We kept walking.  
And I kept talking.  
About how people try to sell you ideas.  
About how not everything that looks friendly *is*.  
About how language is a tool—and sometimes a weapon.

I told her stories are powerful.  
That repeating something over and over doesn’t make it true.  
That even smiling faces can carry bad ideas.

Later that day, we sat in the shade with ice pops.  
She picked up a rock and said,  
“This one’s a voter. But they have to *ask* questions first.”

I kissed the top of her sweaty head.  
“Exactly.”

### Listener Reflection Prompt:

- What was your first memory of political messaging?
- How do you explain “truth” to children in a world full of campaigns, spin, and slogans?
- When did you learn the difference between persuasion and manipulation?

### Ritual Invitation:

Choose a “word of the day” with your kid—or yourself—that unlocks a deeper conversation.  
It can be something simple. “Trust.” “Power.” “Neighbor.”  
Then look around: where is that word being shaped, sold, or stolen?
