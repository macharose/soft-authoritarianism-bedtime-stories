Once, not long ago and also ages ago, a tree crossed the ocean.  
A Norwegian Spruce, roots tucked into ship and soil, quietly threading the world together.  
He is called Tree Friend now, and we greet him by name.

Tree Friend stands apart, but never alone. His branches drape the ground like cloaks of memory, heavy with morning mist and old knowledge.  
He carries magic — not the showy kind, but the kind that hums low in your chest if you remember to listen.  
The kind that seeps through your soles if you dare to walk barefoot through dew.

You do not earn Tree Friend's magic by proving yourself.  
There is no prize for cleverness, no secret test.  
The only key is remembering that trees have always been alive in a way that *sees* us, not just shelters us.

If you approach with your heart tuned to that old way of knowing — the way that hums through roots and river stones and early fog — Tree Friend will offer you his gift.  
It will not look like much at first. Maybe a stronger breath. Maybe a thought, clean and sharp as a cold morning. Maybe the quiet certainty that you are not walking alone.

But make no mistake: it is a gift.  
The kind that, once accepted, makes you a little bit harder to kill.  
The kind that weaves you a little tighter into the world.

Say hello to the trees.  
Tell them your secrets.  
Let them answer in the language they've always spoken — the language we were meant to hear.
