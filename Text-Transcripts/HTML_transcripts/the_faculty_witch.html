<h3>“The Faculty Witch and the Curse of Neutrality”<br><small>(from Soft Authoritarianism, and Other Bedtime Stories)</small></h3>

<p>Once upon a time, in a forest of ivory towers, there lived a faculty witch.</p>

<p>She wasn’t the kind with green skin or cauldrons—no, this one wore soft sneakers and carried a syllabus sharpened to a point.<br>
Her spells? Slideshows.<br>
Her familiars? A rotating cast of quietly radical guest artists, most of them women, most of them Black or brown, all of them inconveniently excellent.</p>

<p>She taught her students how to build worlds.</p>

<p>She said, <strong>“Production design is architecture for emotion,”</strong> and no one stopped her.<br>
So she kept going.</p>

<p>One day, in the middle of a lesson on power and space, she invoked the name of an orange goblin king—<strong>Trump</strong>—and the room shifted.<br>
A tension spell, thick and institutional.<br>
The witch felt it, like a fog in her throat.</p>

<p>She knew the rules:<br>
Don’t stir the classroom.<br>
Don’t wake the donors.<br>
Don’t speak the unspeakable.</p>

<p>So she paused.<br>
For a moment, the spell of compliance tempted her.</p>

<p>But then she said,<br>
<strong>“No. I’m not sorry I said it. If you’re offended…”</strong> <em>hard pause</em><br>
<strong>“…I didn’t mean to offend you on this very liberal campus you chose to attend.”</strong></p>

<p>And the room didn’t collapse.</p>

<p>Some students looked down.<br>
Some nodded.<br>
One smiled like they were seeing the moon for the first time.</p>

<p>Later that week, the witch went walking with a small child—her own.<br>
They found a tree with arms like a dancer and named it <em>Tree Friend</em>.<br>
They told the tree stories, like:</p>

<blockquote><em>“Today I remembered I am allowed to speak plainly.”</em></blockquote>

<p>And the tree, being a very old tree, listened without judgment.</p>

<p>And that night, while the witch folded laundry and the child sorted sticks, they both felt it:<br>
<strong>the curse of neutrality had cracked, just a little.</strong></p>

<p>It wasn’t much.<br>
Just one story.</p>

<p>But stories, as you know, are spells.</p>
