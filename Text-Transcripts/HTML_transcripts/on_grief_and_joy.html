      <h2>006 ‚Äî On Grief and Joy, in the Heartless State</h2>
<p><em>Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories<br>Transcript for GitHub</em></p>

<p>Once, a little girl lost her dog‚Äîa true companion, a friend, a soul mate.<br>
His name was Cesar. He was family. And then he was gone.</p>

<p>She didn‚Äôt know how to say all that yet.<br>
But she <em>felt</em> it.<br>
In her chest. In her bones. In the way she carried his memory like a favorite blanket she didn‚Äôt want to let go of.</p>

<p>She wept.<br>
Quietly. Loudly. Confused and clear all at once.<br>
And in her grief, she taught her mother something important:<br>
<strong>Love leaves a shape behind.</strong> And that shape deserves space.</p>

<p>The world outside didn't know how to sit with sadness.<br>
It rushed toward perfection. Plastic. Algorithms. Smile-for-the-camera culture.<br>
It sold "healing" in the form of distractions‚Äînew toys, shiny filters, promises of happy endings.</p>

<p>But grief isn't a bug in the system. It's a feature of love.<br>
And in a state that punishes slowness, stillness, or softness‚Äî<br>
grieving with your whole heart is rebellion.</p>

<p>So we grieved together.</p>

<p>We talked about Cesar.<br>
We drew pictures of him.<br>
We said his name out loud.<br>
We said: <strong>‚ÄúWe are sad because we love him that much.‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>There was no fixing it.<br>
No filling the space with stuff.<br>
Only holding it.</p>

<p>That holding‚Äî<br>
is how we remember.<br>
That holding‚Äî<br>
is how we resist.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Listener Reflection Prompt:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What grief are you carrying that the world tells you to hide?</li>
  <li>How can you honor your love instead of numbing your loss?</li>
  <li>What does emotional intelligence look like in your home?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ritual Invitation:</h3>
<p>Create a small altar for someone or something you've lost.<br>
It could be a photo, a collar, a flower, or just a rock that feels like them.<br>
Let it stay for a while. Let it speak.</p>

<h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
<p>This story was born from watching my daughter deeply miss our dog, Cesar.<br>
He was more than a pet‚Äîhe was a soul companion.<br>
In her sadness, I saw not weakness but clarity: an emotional honesty that so many of us lose as we grow.<br>
I want to teach her, and remind myself, that grief is not something to escape.<br>
It‚Äôs proof of love.<br>
And in this world, where feelings are flattened by consumerism, allowing ourselves to truly mourn is an act of resistance.<br>
Stay tender. Stay real. Hold the space.</p>
