    <h2>005 – The Last Summer of Reason</h2>
<p><em>A fable within a fable.</em></p>
<p><em>Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories<br>Transcript for GitHub</em></p>

<hr />

<p>A fable within a fable.</p>

<p>A world where books were outlawed, where joy and art were criminalized, where beauty was rebranded as dangerous.</p>

<p>The thing is—<br>
That world didn’t look like a nightmare.<br>
It looked like a slow, quiet shift.<br>
Like water heating under a frog.<br>
He warned us.</p>

<p><strong>Tahar.</strong></p>

<p>All of us—that when authoritarianism begins to stretch its grubby little fingers into our schools, our culture, our language, our stories,<br>
when questioning becomes dangerous,<br>
fiction becomes fatal.</p>

<p>I want to scream.<br>
But with a whisper.</p>

<p>I’ve realized how fast freedom can vanish<br>
when we stop noticing the temperature rise.</p>

<p>When we fail to notice the absurdity of complacency.</p>

<p>But that is dangerous.<br>
Tahar was murdered.<br>
They tried to erase him—<br>
from the world, from memory, from meaning.<br>
But they forgot:</p>

<p><strong>You cannot unwrite what’s already been read.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h4>🪶 Patron Saint Tahar Djaout</h4>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Guardian of Dangerous Pages<br>
<strong>Power:</strong> Makes dictators flinch at metaphors<br>
<strong>Invocation:</strong> Write like someone is reading in secret<br>
<strong>Blessing:</strong> May your words make space for others to breathe</p>

<hr />

<h4>🗝 Themes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fiction as rebellion</li>
  <li>The slow slide into control</li>
  <li>How soft censorship kills curiosity</li>
  <li>Memory as resistance</li>
  <li>Art as armor</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>📎 Additional Notes</h4>
<p>I read <em>The Last Summer of Reason</em> around 2010, and it’s one of the few books that stuck with me—living in my subconscious as I watched the world unravel.</p>

<p>When I learned that the author, <strong>Tahar Djaout</strong>—an Algerian journalist and poet—was murdered for being anti-authoritarian, I knew this was something I’d need to keep my eye on where I live.</p>

<p>And here we are.</p>

<p>In our technofascist future,<br>
watching oligarchs feud on Twitter.</p>

<p><em>The Last Summer of Reason</em> helped me understand how <strong>Soft Authoritarianism</strong> fades into full authoritarianism. Though a work of fiction, it shows how easily things start small and innocuous—until they’re at your door.</p>

<p>I want this fable to awaken you.<br>
To help you feel the slow boil under our feet.<br>
To remind you: we still have the words.</p>

<p><strong>Write like someone is reading in secret.</strong></p>
