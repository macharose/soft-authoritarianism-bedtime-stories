      <h2>014 — Word of the Day Is Propaganda</h2>
      <p><em>Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories<br>Transcript for GitHub</em></p>

      <hr />

      <p>It was Election Day in New York City.<br>
      The air was thick with humidity and the scent of last-minute promises.</p>

      <p>Canvassers fanned out across sidewalks, train stations, playground entrances—grinning wide and armed with glossy flyers.<br>
      Some wore branded shirts. Some carried clipboards. Most carried the same assumption: that handing a bright-colored political ad to a 3-year-old was “cute.”</p>

      <p>And maybe it was.</p>

      <p>Until she looked up and asked:<br>
      <strong>“Why they give me this?”</strong></p>

      <p>I didn’t flinch.<br>
      I looked her in the eyes and said,<br>
      <strong>“Today’s word of the day is propaganda.”</strong></p>

      <p>Her grip tightened on the flyer like it had just grown teeth.<br>
      The canvasser laughed nervously.<br>
      I did not.</p>

      <p>We kept walking.<br>
      And I kept talking.<br>
      About how people try to sell you ideas.<br>
      About how not everything that looks friendly <em>is</em>.<br>
      About how language is a tool—and sometimes a weapon.</p>

      <p>I told her stories are powerful.<br>
      That repeating something over and over doesn’t make it true.<br>
      That even smiling faces can carry bad ideas.</p>

      <p>Later that day, we sat in the shade with ice pops.<br>
      She picked up a rock and said,<br>
      “This one’s a voter. But they have to <em>ask</em> questions first.”</p>

      <p>I kissed the top of her sweaty head.<br>
      “Exactly.”</p>

      <h4>🎧 Listener Reflection Prompt:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>What was your first memory of political messaging?</li>
        <li>How do you explain “truth” to children in a world full of campaigns, spin, and slogans?</li>
        <li>When did you learn the difference between persuasion and manipulation?</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>🪄 Ritual Invitation:</h4>
      <p>Choose a “word of the day” with your kid—or yourself—that unlocks a deeper conversation.<br>
      It can be something simple. “Trust.” “Power.” “Neighbor.”<br>
      Then look around: where is that word being shaped, sold, or stolen?</p>
