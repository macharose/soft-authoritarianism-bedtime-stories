<p><em>or, how to undo a system without setting yourself on fire</em></p>
<p><em>Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories<br>Transcript for GitHub</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Some people plant flowers.<br>
I plant questions. And lettuce. And Paul Robeson tomatoes from a museum seed bank.</p>

<p>I throw seeds over fences and I talk to the plants like they’ll remember me in the next life.<br>
Because they might.</p>

<p>I don’t work in advertising because I believe in brands.<br>
I work in advertising because I know that value is assigned. Arbitrary. A game.<br>
And I like bending the rules from the inside.</p>

<p>I don’t just center People of Color.<br>
I center Black folks. African Americans. Californians. Myself.<br>
Because those are the stories I know in my bones. And if I don’t tell them, who will?</p>

<p>Every semester, I tell my students they’re gatekeepers.<br>
Even if they’re broke, overlooked, or stuck.<br>
Because someone’s looking up at them, waiting for the door to open.<br>
I tell them to fill the room with all their parts. Even the messy ones.</p>

<p>I ask questions that make capitalism itch.<br>
I wonder aloud if Western ways are the only ways. (They’re not.)<br>
I believe we get freer when we imagine different shapes for the world.<br>
I believe that includes how we treat trees. And neighbors. And ourselves.</p>

<p>I believe in men—when they are fighting the right things.<br>
And I believe in women who refuse to make themselves small.<br>
I believe in being the person I want to be, not the one the system wrote a script for.</p>

<p>Some days, all I do is plant a seed.<br>
But that’s enough.<br>
Because I know how many futures live inside one small thing.</p>

<h4>🌱 Listener Reflection Prompt</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What seeds have you planted—literal or metaphorical?</li>
  <li>Who are you centering when you work? When you rest? When you make decisions?</li>
  <li>What version of yourself have you refused to shrink into this week?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>✍️ Ritual Invitation</h4>
<p>Add your seed story to the <code>/rituals</code> folder.<br>
It doesn’t have to be a manifesto. Just tell us what you’re growing.<br>
Even one sentence counts.</p>

<hr />

<h4>📝 Additional Notes</h4>
<p>Plant actual seeds.</p>

<p>This story was inspired by a pack of <em>True Love Paul Robeson</em> tomato seeds I got at the Oakland Museum.</p>

<p>I thought they had expired, and I opted to plant them nearly six years later—and they sprouted—offering fruit, resistance, and an opportunity for me to give food plants away to friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>Saving and sharing food seeds is a quiet, radical form of resistance. It’s a vote for collective survival, biodiversity, and sovereignty. Even casually sprouting in an AeroGarden and gifting plants is a way of saying: we take care of each other.</p>

<p>You’re keeping knowledge alive. You’re preserving access. You’re choosing abundance over control. That’s not just friendly—that’s revolutionary in a world where food systems are increasingly privatized and fragile.</p>

<p><strong>Stay off the grid and in the soil.</strong></p>
