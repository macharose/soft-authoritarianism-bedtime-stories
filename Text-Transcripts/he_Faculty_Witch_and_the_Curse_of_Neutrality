# “The Faculty Witch and the Curse of Neutrality”  
*(from Soft Authoritarianism, and Other Bedtime Stories)*

Once upon a time, in a forest of ivory towers, there lived a faculty witch.

She wasn’t the kind with green skin or cauldrons—no, this one wore soft sneakers and carried a syllabus sharpened to a point.  
Her spells? Slideshows.  
Her familiars? A rotating cast of quietly radical guest artists, most of them women, most of them Black or brown, all of them inconveniently excellent.

She taught her students how to build worlds.

She said, **“Production design is architecture for emotion,”** and no one stopped her.  
So she kept going.

One day, in the middle of a lesson on power and space, she invoked the name of an orange goblin king—**Trump**—and the room shifted.  
A tension spell, thick and institutional.  
The witch felt it, like a fog in her throat.

She knew the rules:  
Don’t stir the classroom.  
Don’t wake the donors.  
Don’t speak the unspeakable.

So she paused.  
For a moment, the spell of compliance tempted her.

But then she said,  
**“No. I’m not sorry I said it. If you’re offended…”** *hard pause*  
**“…I didn’t mean to offend you on this very liberal campus you chose to attend.”**

And the room didn’t collapse.

Some students looked down.  
Some nodded.  
One smiled like they were seeing the moon for the first time.

Later that week, the witch went walking with a small child—her own.  
They found a tree with arms like a dancer and named it *Tree Friend.*  
They told the tree stories, like:  
> *“Today I remembered I am allowed to speak plainly.”*

And the tree, being a very old tree, listened without judgment.

And that night, while the witch folded laundry and the child sorted sticks, they both felt it:  
**the curse of neutrality had cracked, just a little.**

It wasn’t much.  
Just one story.

But stories, as you know, are spells.
