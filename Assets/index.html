    <h2>000 ‚Äì Why <em>Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories</em> Exists</h2>
    <p><em>Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories</em><br><strong>Project Manifesto</strong></p>
  
    <p>This project is part catharsis, part resistance.<br>
    It‚Äôs a living archive built out of story, code, ritual, and care.</p>
  
    <p>We are living in a time when repression doesn‚Äôt always look like boots and batons.<br>
    It often wears a smile.<br>
    It calls itself neutral.<br>
    It buries dissent in bureaucracy, silences voices through policy, and makes survival feel like personal failure.<br>
    This is <strong>soft authoritarianism</strong> ‚Äî and we‚Äôre soaking in it.</p>
  
    <p>These stories are not solutions.  
    They are <em>tools</em>.  
    They are <em>mirrors</em>.  
    They are <em>maps for remembering</em> what we already know ‚Äî and what so many of us already do.</p>
  
    <p>Some of us feed neighbors.<br>
    Some plant seeds, teach children, write dangerously, hold community, love messily, care loudly, or just stay soft when the world wants us hard.<br>
    All of it counts.</p>
  
    <p>This project exists to remind us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resistance doesn‚Äôt always look like fire. Sometimes it looks like a nap. Or a protest milk carton. Or reading banned books aloud.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Ritual is a weapon. Imagination is infrastructure.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What we do in small, quiet ways ‚Äî in parenting, in libraries, in gardens and classrooms and code ‚Äî matters.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>This is a space for slow rebellion.<br>
    For storytelling as survival.<br>
    For tools you can use now, or later, or when you‚Äôre ready.</p>
  
    <p>It‚Äôs not perfect.  
    It‚Äôs not meant to be.  
    But it‚Äôs <em>something</em>, and that‚Äôs how we begin.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories</strong> is a subversive travel guide to surviving and reimagining life under late-stage capitalism, creeping authoritarianism, and chronic disillusionment. It‚Äôs equal parts survival manual, ideological scrapbook, and open-source manifesto.</p>
  
    <p>This project exists because the world is exhausting, and rage alone isn't sustainable.<br>
    Born from catharsis but grounded in praxis, it offers tools for resistance that are tangible, communal, and sometimes even soft.<br>
    Because not all rebellion wears combat boots ‚Äî sometimes it grows heirloom tomatoes, or teaches a toddler to name trees, or organizes a dinner party that becomes a rogue salon.</p>
  
    <p>We believe that resistance lives in the quiet as much as the loud.<br>
    That you don‚Äôt have to be an activist to be subversive.<br>
    That education, mutual aid, childcare, food justice, housing, and joy are radical.<br>
    And that fiction, art, and humor might be the most efficient weapons we‚Äôve got.</p>
  
    <p>This isn‚Äôt a blueprint for utopia.  
    It‚Äôs a breadcrumb trail for those who sense something‚Äôs wrong but don‚Äôt know where to begin.<br>
    You‚Äôre not alone. Welcome to the portal.</p>
  
    <p><em>This is art. Not legal advice.</em></p>
