# 000 – Why *Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories* Exists

*Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories*  
*Project Manifesto*

---

This project is part catharsis, part resistance.  
It’s a living archive built out of story, code, ritual, and care.

We are living in a time when repression doesn’t always look like boots and batons.  
It often wears a smile.  
It calls itself neutral.  
It buries dissent in bureaucracy, silences voices through policy, and makes survival feel like personal failure.  
This is **soft authoritarianism** — and we’re soaking in it.

These stories are not solutions.  
They are *tools*.  
They are *mirrors*.  
They are *maps for remembering* what we already know — and what so many of us already do.

Some of us feed neighbors.  
Some plant seeds, teach children, write dangerously, hold community, love messily, care loudly, or just stay soft when the world wants us hard.  
All of it counts.

This project exists to remind us:

- **Resistance doesn’t always look like fire. Sometimes it looks like a nap. Or a protest milk carton. Or reading banned books aloud.**
- **Ritual is a weapon. Imagination is infrastructure.**
- **What we do in small, quiet ways — in parenting, in libraries, in gardens and classrooms and code — matters.**

This is a space for slow rebellion.  
For storytelling as survival.  
For tools you can use now, or later, or when you’re ready.

It’s not perfect.  
It’s not meant to be.  
But it’s *something*, and that’s how we begin.

Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories is a subversive travel guide to surviving and reimagining life under late-stage capitalism, creeping authoritarianism, and chronic disillusionment. It’s equal parts survival manual, ideological scrapbook, and open-source manifesto. This project exists because the world is exhausting, and rage alone isn't sustainable.
Born from catharsis but grounded in praxis, it offers tools for resistance that are tangible, communal, and sometimes even soft. Because not all rebellion wears combat boots—sometimes it grows heirloom tomatoes, or teaches a toddler to name trees, or organizes a dinner party that becomes a rogue salon.
We believe that resistance lives in the quiet as much as the loud. That you don’t have to be an activist to be subversive. That education, mutual aid, childcare, food justice, housing, and joy are radical. And that fiction, art, and humor might be the most efficient weapons we’ve got.
This isn’t a blueprint for utopia. It’s a breadcrumb trail for those who sense something’s wrong but don’t know where to begin. You’re not alone. Welcome to the portal.
