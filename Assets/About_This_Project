# 000 – Why *Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories* Exists

*Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories*  
*Project Manifesto*

---

This project is part catharsis, part resistance.  
It’s a living archive built out of story, code, ritual, and care.

We are living in a time when repression doesn’t always look like boots and batons.  
It often wears a smile.  
It calls itself neutral.  
It buries dissent in bureaucracy, silences voices through policy, and makes survival feel like personal failure.  
This is **soft authoritarianism** — and we’re soaking in it.

These stories are not solutions.  
They are *tools*.  
They are *mirrors*.  
They are *maps for remembering* what we already know — and what so many of us already do.

Some of us feed neighbors.  
Some plant seeds, teach children, write dangerously, hold community, love messily, care loudly, or just stay soft when the world wants us hard.  
All of it counts.

This project exists to remind us:

- **Resistance doesn’t always look like fire. Sometimes it looks like a nap. Or a protest milk carton. Or reading banned books aloud.**
- **Ritual is a weapon. Imagination is infrastructure.**
- **What we do in small, quiet ways — in parenting, in libraries, in gardens and classrooms and code — matters.**

This is a space for slow rebellion.  
For storytelling as survival.  
For tools you can use now, or later, or when you’re ready.

It’s not perfect.  
It’s not meant to be.  
But it’s *something*, and that’s how we begin.
