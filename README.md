Soft Authoritarianism and Other Bedtime Stories
Whispers, rituals, and resistance in the night.

A slow archive of bedtime stories for the unraveling.
Told by a mother, a maker, a resistor. Documented in the margins of empire. Meant to be heard.

## âœ¨ Concept Summary
A tender rebellion told in whispers. This is a collection of stories, real and surreal, about academic micro-rebellions, nature rituals, and quiet resistance under soft authoritarianism. They are best heard before sleep.

## ðŸŽ­ Tone and Themes
Playful, poetic, defiant.
Themes: nature, resistance, academia, identity, joy under constraint.
