Whispers, rituals, and resistance in the night.

## âœ¨ What This Is

A tender rebellion told in whispers.  
Stories real and surreal, about academic micro-rebellions, nature rituals, and quiet resistance under soft authoritarianism.  
Meant to be heard before sleep, or in the pause between obligations.
